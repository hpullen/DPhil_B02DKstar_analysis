        \caption{Comparison of PID efficiencies between $B^0 \to DK^{*0}$ signal and $B^0 \to D\rho^0$ background for  Run 2. Efficiencies were calculated using Monte Carlo with PIDCalib. The ratio between the Run 1 and Run 2 signal vs. $B^0 \to D\rho^0$ ratios is used to scale the Run 2 $B \to D\pi\pi$ yield with respect to the Run 1 yield in the fit to data.}
