1. To run a single toy and plot the fit:

   root FitToy.C

This will save invariant mass plots to one of the following directories:
   Plots/free_Kpi_fixed_expo
   Plots/free_Kpi_free_expo
   Plots/fixed_Kpi_free_expo
depending on what the booleans in FitToy.C are set to.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. To run N jobs (each job produces 4 toys, so you will end up with 4N toys):

   ./run_many_jobs.sh N

(Note: this submits pplxint batch jobs to the veryshort queue.)
This will save N .root files to one of the following directories:
   Results/free_Kpi_fixed_expo
   Results/free_Kpi_free_expo
   Results/fixed_Kpi_free_expo
again, depending on the settings in FitToy.C.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. To plot the results (values, errors, pulls and significance) of these many toys:

   root "PlotResults.C(\"dirname\")"

where "dirname" is the directory containing the .root files. The results for every
.root file in the directory will be plotted and saved to the corresponding plots
directory, e.g. if you ran 
   root "PlotResults.C(\"Results/free_Kpi_fixed_expo\")" 
you would find plots save to Plots/free_Kpi_fixed_expo/
