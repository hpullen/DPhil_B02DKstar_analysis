# B0 -> D0 K\*0 analysis using Run 1 + Run 2 data


This repositoruy contains code for performing the analysis of B0 -> D0 K\*0 decays, with D0 -> two body modes (Kpi, piK, KK, pipi) and four body modes (Kpipipi, piKpipi, pipipi).


## Location of data files

The ROOT files for the analysis are stored on the Oxford data disc:
